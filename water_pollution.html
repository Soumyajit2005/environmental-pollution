        Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies (e.g.lakes,rivers,
        oceans,aquifers and groundwater).Water pollution occurs when pollutants
        are directly or indirectly discharged into water bodies without adequate
        treatment to remove harmful compounds.

            These occur in industrial places and activities such as oil
            refineries, coal power plants, construction, mining & smelting,
            transportation, agricultural use of pesticides and insecticides, as
            well as household activities
          </td>
          <td>
            Chemical pollution can affect the delicate balance of the Earth's
            ecosystems. Mining, agriculture and waste disposal have caused
            substantial soil pollution. The presence of heavy metals like
            cadmium, mercury and lead can affect soil quality and reduce the
            number of micro-organisms that support soil fertility

            Apart from septic systems, chemicals, mining, landfills, animal
            wastes, and road runoff, the two primary anthropogenic drivers of
            pollution of groundwater are fertilizer application and
            inappropriate industrial waste handling

            Drinking contaminated groundwater can have serious health effects.

            contamination from septic tank waste

            Groundwater remediation is the process that is used to treat
            polluted groundwater by removing the pollutants or converting them
            into harmless products.

            Nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, occur naturally, but
            most of the nutrients in our waterways come from human activities
            and sourcesâ€”fertilizers, wastewater, automobile exhaust, animal
            waste.

            Nutrient pollution damages the environment and harms water quality.

            and other organisms need to survive
