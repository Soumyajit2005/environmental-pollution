        In a general sense, soil pollution definition is the presence of toxic
        chemicals (pollutants or contaminants) in soil in high enough
        concentrations to be of risk to human health and/or ecosystem.
        Additionally, even when the levels of contaminants in soil are not of
        risk, soil pollution may occur simply due to the fact that the levels of
        the contaminants in soil exceed the levels that are naturally present in
        soil (in the case of contaminants which occur naturally in soil).
